<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project is created to provide access to an online library. This library is not real, it is only a project to learn and improve my skills with Django and backend development. 
In this project, there are 4 roles:
- Visitor: This user can go through the books and authors but it does not have any permission.
- Registered user: This user can borrow books for a maximum of 4 weeks.
- Librarian: This user has the next permissions:
  - Borrow books
  - Let other users borrow books
  - Renew the date for borrowed books
Create books
  - Add books copies (As the books are considered physical copies, and not digital)
  - Add authors
- Superuser or admin: This user can access to the admin site and manage all the users, borrowed books, authors, books, books copies, languages, genres, and others. 

The project was created from scratch following [Mozilla developer's tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) about Django.

### Built and Deployed With

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<!-- WHAT DID I LEARN -->
## What did I learn?

In this project, I improved my skills as a web developer working with a backend framework and managing a database. I learned about Django:
- How to set-up a project
- Use models
- Create the view for admins 
- Creating lists and retrieving data from the database
- Create sessions, authentication, and permissions
- Create secure forms
- Create tests to check there are no problems and automate unit testing
- Deploying the project to Heroku and change from the development environment to the production environment.
